**Docker Compose**

If you use containers to run the MongoDB you can create a *Docker Compose* instead the command line command, that is useful when you run more than one 
container. Because the fictionional Bank System includes more than one service, each one with a different DataBase we use a Docker Compose file to start all the containers at the same time.

**To run the docker compose use the following commmand**

```docker-compose up```
